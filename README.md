Intro:

Aim : To profile genetic STR (Simple Tandem Repeats) variations which occur newly(de
novo) in offspring, we have taken parent off-spring (trio) WGS data from the 1000 Genome
project. Cataloguing population-specific STR de novo variation frequencies ( minor &
major alleles), mutational dynamics, Parental specific effects on germline mutation rates.
Developed a command line tool which identifies de novo mutations (STRs, SNPs) and phases their 
parent of origin given the trio family Alignment(.Bam/.Sam) files using statistical methods &
Python (Custom algorithms). also involved in variant analysis. Long reads and Short reads are supported.
